# Solutions Architect + Full‑Stack Developer  

Hey, I'm John Ryan — I design and build intelligent systems that blend AI, solid engineering, and thoughtful design.

Before diving deep into AI, I led integration engineering at Amazon and Sharethrough scaling global ad-tech systems, reducing onboarding friction, and solving revenue-critical challenges across large-scale systems. Along the way, I built developer tools, APIs, and payment systems that improved reliability and unlocked new efficiencies.

Whether it's a broken workflow or an untapped capability, I love creating systems that move faster, think smarter, and scale better.
