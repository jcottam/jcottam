# Solutions Architect + Full‑Stack Developer  

Hey, I'm John Ryan — I design and build intelligent systems that blend AI, solid engineering, and thoughtful design.

Before diving deep into AI, I led integration engineering at Amazon and Sharethrough — scaling global ad-tech systems, reducing onboarding friction, and solving revenue-critical challenges. Being on the front lines with customers taught me how to design better integrations and streamline systems — leading to new developer tools, APIs, and process improvements that boosted reliability and efficiency.

I build systems that help people move faster, think smarter, and scale their impact.
