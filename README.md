# Solutions Architect + Full‑Stack Developer  
> **Find problems. Design solutions. Ship and scale.**

I build software that blends AI with strong engineering and thoughtful design. My current focus is on agentic workflows, MCP extensibility, semantic search, and generative systems that help people make smarter, faster decisions.

Before diving deep into AI, I led integration engineering at Amazon and Sharethrough, building ad‑tech platforms that reduced onboarding time, simplified complex integrations, and solved revenue‑critical issues at scale. Along the way, I’ve shipped developer tools, APIs, and secure payment systems that made teams more efficient and reliable.

I love uncovering workflow bottlenecks and building systems that dramatically increase efficiency — whether for startups scaling fast or enterprises modernizing legacy processes.
