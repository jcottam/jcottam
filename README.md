# Solutions Architect + Full‑Stack Developer  
> **Identify problems. Engineer solutions. Ship products.**

I build **production-grade autonomous AI agents** that automate customer workflows and content pipelines with end‑to‑end visibility and security.

Before the AI wave, I developed ad‑tech integration platforms and force multipliers that delivered real leverage—cutting onboarding time, streamlining publisher integrations, and solving revenue‑critical issues at scale.

- Led North American integration engineering for Amazon and Sharethrough, helping publishers onboard into programmatic exchanges
- Built browser tools that cut troubleshooting time and improved developer efficiency across teams 
- Designed & documented APIs and SDKs powering enterprise partnerships
- Engineered secure multi‑party payment systems for marketplace businesses

I specialize in finding workflow bottlenecks and building systems that **10× execution speed**—from start‑ups scaling fast to enterprises modernizing legacy processes.
