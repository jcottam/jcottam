# Solutions Architect + Full‑Stack Developer  
> **Identify problems. Engineer solutions. Ship products.**

I build and ship software that leverages AI — grounded in solid engineering principles. Recently, I’ve been exploring agentic workflows, MCP extensibility, semantic search, and generative systems for advertising and decision‑making. New tech excites me, but first principles, usability, and taste always come first.

Before the AI wave, I led integration engineering for Amazon and Sharethrough, building ad‑tech platforms that cut onboarding time, streamlined publisher integrations, and solved revenue‑critical challenges at scale. I also shipped developer tools, APIs, and secure payment systems that boosted execution speed and enterprise reliability.

I love turning complex workflows into efficient, scalable systems — whether for startups moving fast or enterprises modernizing legacy infrastructure.
