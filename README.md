# Solutions Architect + Full‑Stack Developer  
> **Identify problems. Engineer solutions. Ship products.**

I build **production‑ready AI agents** that automate customer workflows, content pipelines, and decision-making — systems that run intelligently on their own.  

Before the AI wave, I focused on building **force multipliers** — tools that made teams faster and products stronger:

- Led an international team of support engineers to streamline troubleshooting  
- Built browser tools that cut issue resolution time dramatically  
- Designed and documented enterprise-grade APIs & SDKs  
- Engineered secure payment systems for marketplace businesses  

I specialize in finding **workflow bottlenecks** and building **automation that scales** — tools and agents that 10× execution velocity.
